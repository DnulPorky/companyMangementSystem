/**
 * It's a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody â€“ which eliminates 
 * the need to annotate every request handling method of the controller class with the @ResponseBody annotation.
 * Every request handling method of the controller class automatically serializes return objects into HttpResponse.
 * @Controller is simply a specialization of the @Component class and 
 * allows implementation classes to be autodetected through the classpath scanning.
 * A controller is a class that handles request and responds with informations of some sort(Spring MVC framework concept)
